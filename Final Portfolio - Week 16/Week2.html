    <h1 style="text-align:center">Learning Styles:</h1>
         The author of the article and the studies referenced within are seemingly of the opinion that there is no “best” style of learning (visual, auditory, reading/writing, kinesthetic) that would produce “better” results for an individual. I can’t argue with their research/study results, but I am not so fast to dismiss the idea. I don’t think the question should be “Which of these learning styles makes you have better grades?”, but rather “Which of these learning styles makes you the most interested in the subject?”.  
    <br>    Simply, I think that sometimes students struggle to be “successful” in school/get good grades, because for whatever reason they are uninterested in the subject. People should implement whichever learning style makes them most engaged in the material. Being engaged or liking the subject would trigger other beneficial habits within the learning process (i.e. repetition, self testing, more of a personal connection) that empirical research has shown to produce better grades. I also think that students sometimes use simple retention strategies like flash cards, sporkle, etc. because they do not have the time for anything else. This could explain some of why the anatomy class students even while knowing their preferred style of learning chose to use others. </br>
    These learning styles can be used in any discipline, but I think that different learning styles are better suited for certain subjects. For instance, I can’t imagine inspiring academic excellence within a class full of film majors by only having them reading and writing, hence there are many visual, auditory and kinesthetic components of those classes. On the other hand, it would not be the most useful for an environmental studies student to strictly mimic the sounds & movements of the natural world.

<h1 style="text-align:center">Last Lecture - Randy Pausch </h1>
<br>
<p>The part of the video when Randy was talking about the ETC Masters program really stuck with me. He says “None of that book learning stuff. Don and I have no patience for that book learning stuff…. All your time is spent in small teams making stuff.” I found that quite encouraging for a professor to say, because it’s a rather unorthodox way of approaching learning. I find that I actually love learning when it’s not confined by the construct of the school system. As soon as someone tells me I have to learn something, I immediately no longer want to learn it. It feels like this constant cycle of memorizing, testing, and forgetting. I do better when there's a purpose for what I’m learning, and I love what I’m learning. Likewise, small group projects are a medium that I thrive in. I love learning with my co-writer as we write our TV show scripts, and finding out poetic rhythm together. I’m also working on a passion-project TV show with a close friend of mine, and consequently many other friends. The relationships we have with one-another further our want to learn and better the project, because we want to give it our all for the other. I think relationships are on my mind, because Randy was all about them. I loved how he started by saying his wife and kids among other things are more important than his work. Throughout his talk he describes accomplishment after accomplishment, yet never really takes credit himself  rather gives it to his mom, dad, family, teachers, mentors, friends, colleagues. His quote “And I’m going to keep having fun, every day I have left.” inspires me to take his positive mindset into the next brick walls I face. </p>

<p>This art work represents my idea of culture, because in this world there are cats and there are birds, literally.</p>
<p>Figuratively, it is representative because there are people (cats) that are always chasing others (birds) & sometimes</p>
<p>the cats eat the birds. #EatTheRich</p>
