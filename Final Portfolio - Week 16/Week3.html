    <p> This week I told the story of a cat who is a lot too loud when he visits the library!</p>
    <p> Thankfully he finds a magical friend that gives him some helium to soften his voice and all is well.</p>
    <p> I also added a conversation counter to show that with just a couple direct conversations, a lot can be accomplished.</p>
