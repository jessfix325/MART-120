    During the last weeks of the semester we created a simple "Square Escape" game:
<br>
    <br> Week 11 - We created the basic layout and shapes of the game.
    <br> Week 12 - We used handy functions to make the same end product, in a more efficient manner.
    <br> Week 14 - We were introduced to arrays as another helpful tool in coding efficiency/organization.
    <br><br>
    <h1>Controls:</h1>
    <p> - Movement: w, a, s, d keys</p>
    <p> - Click to make another square appear!</p>
