   <p> Homework 1 - 	

    I am honestly new to computer coding and am hoping this class will help me not feel like a “beginner user”. I prefer the GUI method of storage, because I am already familiar with it from working with computers and phones throughout the years. CLI is a bit more confusing for me, and seems unnecessarily complicated when I can just drag and drop files from my desktop applications. I can see how CLI’s are useful in search engines and for looking through large libraries/lists. CLI’s seem like they would require less processing power as it is only text compared to graphic components. It is useful that CLI’s are capable of executing every process through only text, but I guess GUI has the advantage of being touch accessible through a mouse. The good ol’ mouse vs. keyboard argument.
