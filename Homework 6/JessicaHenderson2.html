        <h1>Crying Girl at Midnight</h1>

        <p>the crying girl at midnight
        <br> looked up at the moon 
        <br> with sparkles in her eyes 
        <br> and wished for her love 
        <br> she wished on every star 
        <br> but had never gone as far 
        <br> to ask the moon 
        <br> to give her true love 
        <br> she prayed and prayed 
        <br> for the pain to go away 
        <br> but the moon 
        <br> only turned his face away 
        <br> now the crying girl at midnight 
        <br> will cry all day
